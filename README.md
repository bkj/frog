### frog

Port of [DARTS](https://github.com/quark0/darts) neural architecture search.  Currently, have only implemented the CNN portion.  

The search phase produces exactly the same results as the original implementation.  The final training phase has some minor differences for simplicity purposes.  (See [this issue](https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/10) for some details.)

Uses [basenet](https://github.com/bkj/basenet) as a lightweight pytorch wrapper.
